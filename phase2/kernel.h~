// kernel.h, 159, kernel stuff prototyped here

reduce TIME_SIZE to 100 for faster process response time

additional constants:
   GET_TIME 48        // new OS service
   WRITE 49           // new OS service
   READ 50            // new OS service
   STR_SIZE 100       // 100 bytes is max per string
   CR '\r'            // Carriage Return, ASCII #13
   LF '\n'            // LineFeed, ASCII #10 (NewLine)

add a new process state WAIT

define a keyboard type (kb_t) tha has:
   buffer: it has STR_SIZE bytes
   wait_q: our PID queue type
} kb_t;

prototype an external data structure 'kb'

prototype 3 new void-returning services with input tf_t *
      GetTimeService 
      WriteService (calls WriteChar below)
      ReadService
and 2 void-returning subroutines with a char as input
      WriteChar (also called by TimerService)
      KbService
